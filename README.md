## Overview

PLEASE NOTE: This plugin has been updated for but not tested with v2.0.0-rc1. If you encounter any issues, let me know.

This plugin creates a series of commands for setting Powers, Skills, Advantages, and Flaws on characters. It also contains instructions on integrating these into the web portal and character generation.

 **NOTE:** This plugin requires the insertion of code into several areas reserved for custom hooks. It should not cause any merge conflicts as it does not modify the core code; however, the custom files will require updating per the instructions below.

## Installation

Disable the FS3 plugins, as explained in [Enabling and Disabling Plugins](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/config/plugins/).

In the game, run: plugin/install https://github.com/clockworkejd/ares-eshtraits-plugin
